# SchoolManagementFileSerialization
Basic School Management System made with JAVA

This is an example of using File Serialization in JAVA in order to create datbase of Students and Teachers.
All the students are treated as seperate objects which are saved to a file as an Array of objects which then later read by the program.
This approach is fast and reliable for small dataset...
